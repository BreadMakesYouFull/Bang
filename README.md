## Bang markup syntax

### keyword definitions

Assignment Operators:

    !    - for assigning a word or line of text to a !!keyword!!
    !!   - for assigning file contents to a !!keyword!!
    !!!  - for assigning the return value of a shell commmand to a !!keyword!!

### keyword replacement

Keywords are enclosed in exclamation marks ``!!``, a.k.a double bangs

    !!keyword!!

This allows us to replace text with variables:

```
/* style.css */

* {
  background-color: !!bg_colour!!;
  colour: !!color!!;
  font-family: !!font!!;
}
```

And for text files to be modular:

```
<!-- index.html -->
!!html_start!!
!!head!!
!!body!!
!!html_end!!
```

## Process individual files

Process a text file:
```
./bang.sh markup.bang in/example.txt > out/example.txt
```

Process a webpage:
```
./bang.sh markup.bang in/index.html > out/index.html
```

## Process multiple files

You can chain standard bash utilities for processing multiple files.

See ``run.sh``
